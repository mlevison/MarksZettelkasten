**Core Question for me**
What can I learn as practice to create more humour in the world around me.

## Best Ideas
* Humour can help with psychological safety **needs wiki link**
* Humour helps with stress and can be used to build resilience

## Tools
* Take notes - in a notebook - how quaint  — of small incongruities in the day/or client call. They become opportunities for callbacks in follow up emails or just generally other opportunities for later humour.
* Make email sign offs a little more lively than Cheers.
## Practice
* Prompt question - ”I will never understand why ____ is the norm”
* Make notes on things that stand our and are strange about the world

Interesting discovery. I rely too much on things like news and politics as a source of humour.

### The Basics: Truth and Misdirection
Principles
1. At the heart of humour is truth — instead of asking what is funny, start asking what is true.
2. All humour contains surprise and misdirection — Social scientists explain this as the Incongruity-Resolution theory which says humour comes from the incongruity of what we expect and what actually happens. Often humour fails, for lack of misdirection. Either the original circumstance isn’t clear enough or the punch line doesn’t defy it enough
### Part 1: Finding the Funny (Mine Your Life for the Truth)
”Never look for what is funny, look for what’s true and go from there” - Sarah Cooper
“The freshest, most interesting comedy isn’t based on mother-in-law jokes or impressions but on exposing our personalities.” - Del Close (a driving force in Improv comedy)

1. **Incongruity** - Notice Differences - look areas of contrast, contradiction and juxtaposition. For instance look for differences between how I behave and others do. It also be changes in yourself over time - quotes an example from John Mullaney: “I smoked cocaine the night before graduation and now I’m afraid to get the flu shot”. *Many people use the news and political system as a source of incongruity. I think I fall back to the news too easily*. Fallback idea - from Seinfeld - if aliens landed on earth what would they notice.
2. **Emotion** - Notice What You Feel - find ideas by asking “What do you love?” and “What do you hate?” other questions: “What makes me happier than it objectively should? **What frustrates me more than it seems to frustrate other people?** What do I absolutely loathe for no good reason?
	1. Making light of anger is tricky. *Not a good ideas for me* when doing don’t rant directly at someone else. Instead direct them at factionalized cartoon version of the problem. Even better poke fun at your own exgarrated reaction to the problem
3. **Opinion** - Notice What You think - Examine the opinions you hold more strongly than others. Focus on specific beliefs. Consider widely held norms or behaviours that you see as appalling or absurd. Michelle Wolf: “I run every day. I have no idea what I’m training for. ‘Ca use i am not physically gaining any skills. Like, the only jogging is ever going to help in life is if someone tries to rob me by chasing me for three to five miles at a moderately slow pace.”
	1. Prompt question - ”I will never understand why ____ is the norm”
4. **Pain** - Notice What Hurts or Makes you - chances are that many great dinner party stories you tell or hear are about moments of awkwardness or misery. When a comedian tells a painful story our brains zero in on the incongruity between the awfulness of the event the blithe cheery way its told.
5. **Delight** - What makes you smile - Look out for things that make you smile and share them with others
### Part 2: Forming the Funny
* **Exaggerate** - When we heighten observations to the extreme, it creates misdirection by confounding the listener’s expectations. Instead of the normal reaction people are expecting you give them an outlandish one. John Mullaney: “I got a massage recently. Went to a spa to get a massage. … the woman there told me to get underdressed to my comfort level. So I put on a sweater and corduroy pants, and I felt safe.”
* **Create Contrast** - create a juxtaposition between two or more elements. Incongruity bakes this in.
* **Use Specifics** - specific details and colour can lift a joke. Example from Jimmy Fallon: “British researchers are warning that one fifth of the world’s plant species are risk of extinction. Even worse, kale is expected to survive.”
* **Make Analogies** - highlight the ridiculousness of a situation by comparing it to something totally different but equally over the top. Examples: 
	* Hassn Minaj - “Every conversation with my dad is like an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It’s just ninety minutes of buildup to no payoff. *‘That’s the ending??’*”
	* John Mullaney - “I’ve never been killed by hit men, so I don’t what it’s like in the moments before you’re killed by hitmen, but I bet it’s not unlike when you’re on the subway and you realize the mariachi band is about to start playing.“
> > 	The connective tissues of an analogy is almost always about the emotion or opinion the comic feels about the observation they’re describing. To create a great analogy ask yourself what you think or feel about your observation. Make it hyper specific to yourself. Your audience needs to understand why you, specifically, would feel that way. It has be congruent with what they already know about you. Try to find something more universal to compare it to. Something that is generally understood to evoke the same emotion. The subway joke works because most people have been subject to a subway ‘performance attack’. *To build an effective analogy, find the commonality between how you think about the specific thing you’re describing and how most people think or feel about the thing you’re comparing it to*
* **Follow the Rule of Three** - as a simple way of creating misdirection. List two things normal or expected and then add a third unexpected element. This is working off the idea that our brains are looking for patterns. So after seeing two elements our brain is surprised when it goes in a different direction. Example Amy Schumer: “Thank you so much for coming out to my show. This is such a big deal for me. I don’t know if you this, but this past year, I’ve gotten very rich, famous and humble.”
 > > If you had changed the order so that the different element was in the middle it wouldn’t be funny at because it was no longer unexpected.
### Part 3: Spontaneously Funny
* **Signature Stories**
* **Notice the Here and Now** - Find something specific to this group of people at this moment in time. Often the odd or incongruous in the immediate surrroundings. *Never make it about the people, always about the circumstance*.
* **Use Callbacks** refer back to a previous joke or funny moment that happened earlier. This is called a callback. When you hear people laugh make a mental note of the situation and be on the lookout for opportunities to refer back to it again later.
### Part 4: Delivering Funny
* **Pause before the punch** Draw out the silence in anticipation before delivering the punch line.
* **Act it out** take on a characters physical behaviours, voice, mannerisms etc.
* **Dial up the Drama** Raise up the emotion by varying pitch, tone, inflection and pacing of delivery.
* **Repeat Funny lines** - comedians often repeat the punch line to a joke. Seinfeld called it “staying in the bit”. Chris Rock does this a lot.
* **Match Delivery to content** - different people different styles. *Only useful comment here is watch a lot of comedians to find out what works for me*
* **Land with confidence** — Enunciate, speak boldly, clearly and with Authority.
## Putting Your Funny to Work
Words have a profound effect on our psychology and behaviour. This is called the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis - meaning our language can shape our cognition.

* **Talk Like a Human** - Deloitte was suffering from the problem that all their consultants were using buzzwords. The CEO did a survey of their clients to see how they could improve and the response was: “So much bullshit! I wish they’d just talk straight to us.” The solution they wrote a program to scan emails, presentations etc and rate from 1-10 on a Bull scale. 10 is highly readable and 1 is not. The program was entirely voluntary, however it delivered feedback with a humourous tongue lashings like: “you live in a rare, often irreversible states of obscurity”. *The result is that the rating scale and scathing humour gave people permission to start trying new things and taking risks. They also signalled to their clients that they had some fun left in them as an organization.*
* **Send a Message** - when we’re sending emails in a work environment we need to provide others a hint that we’re open to levity. The suggestion make emails an opportunity for connection with others.
* **Use Callbacks** - refer back to something earlier in the day/week/time when people share as a common touch point. Recalling the humour around that helps bring humour into the current moment. 
	*Example*
> ”Saagar, Attached is the updated deck. Per our chat this morning, I think this will be a great tool to start the conversations we need with leadership. Let me know if the deck needs revising or if it now matches my hair: perfect. - Daria “
> Saagar promptly replied in kind: Daria, No revisions needed, matches your hair perfectly. Enjoy the holidays with your family. With beautiful hair always, Saagar
	The example brings them both back to an earlier conversation around hair.
* **Signoffs in emails** examples - asking for a favour - with fingers and toes crossed, apologizing- sheepishly, heads down mode - heavily caffeinated.
* **Add a PS** - adding anything in the PS that makes it clear that you’re a human and not a robot. Ex. From rainy Ottawa, swimming in Ottawa, From the parking lot of a swimming pool.
